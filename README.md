PCF format trading data from HistData

### Downloading Data from HistData

You can download all the data here from [HistData.com](http://www.histdata.com/). The files are in a standard text format that can be imported directly in to an application like MetaTrader4.

If you decide to download the data, be aware the it uses the New York timezone (and adjusts for Daylight Savings). Remember that the PCF formatted files I have provided in this project already have the times converted to UTC, ready for easy conversion to your local timezone.
